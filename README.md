# Decentralized Terraforming Coordination Platform (DTCP)

## Overview
The Decentralized Terraforming Coordination Platform (DTCP) is a blockchain-based system designed to orchestrate large-scale planetary terraforming operations. The platform leverages smart contracts to coordinate resources, track progress, and simulate outcomes across multiple planetary bodies simultaneously.

## Core Components

### Planetary Data Contract
Central repository for environmental metrics and planetary transformation data.

Key features:
- Real-time atmospheric composition monitoring
- Geological activity tracking
- Temperature and pressure mapping
- Water distribution analytics
- Magnetic field measurements
- Solar radiation exposure tracking
- Soil composition analysis

### Resource Allocation Contract
Manages the distribution and utilization of terraforming resources across multiple sites.

Key features:
- Equipment deployment coordination
- Material resource tracking
- Energy allocation management
- Worker deployment scheduling
- Emergency resource reallocation
- Supply chain optimization
- Waste management tracking

### Progress Tracking Contract
Monitors terraforming achievements and milestone completion across different planetary zones.

Key features:
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Milestone verification
- Anomaly detection
- Success metrics tracking
- Timeline management
- Risk assessment
- Compliance verification

### Ecosystem Simulation Contract
Predictive modeling system for terraformed environments.

Key features:
- Climate pattern simulation
- Ecosystem stability prediction
- Species interaction modeling
- Resource sustainability analysis
- Environmental impact assessment
- Long-term evolution projections
- Catastrophe scenario modeling

## Usage

### Environmental Data Submission
```solidity
function submitEnvironmentalData(
    bytes32 planetId,
    bytes32 zoneId,
    EnvironmentalMetrics memory metrics
) external returns (bool)
```

### Resource Allocation
```solidity
function allocateResources(
    bytes32 planetId,
    ResourceType resourceType,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 destinationZone
) external returns (bytes32 allocationId)
```

### Progress Update
```solidity
function updateProgress(
    bytes32 planetId,
    bytes32 milestoneId,
    uint256 completionPercentage,
    bytes memory evidence
) external returns (bool)
```
